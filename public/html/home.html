					Simply type in where you want to jam and click submit. The magic really happens when you grab your smart phone, and visit the same jamSpace. You can now use your phone as an instrument. Why not join multiple ipads and laptops together as well? You can also hook up a midi controller and jam via midi in the same space. Just plug and play. Invite your friends!
